# -Multiple-Linear-Regression-Analysis-of-Coral-Bleaching-Data
Peformed a multiple Linear-Regression-Analysis of the following dataset:
https://www.bco-dmo.org/dataset/773466

I personally looked at the following factors:
- Turbidity
- Temperature_Maximum
- Temperature_Minimum
- Temperature_Mean
- Windspeed
- Depth_m
- Cyclone_Frequency
- Distance_to_Shore
- ClimSST
- Temperature_Kelvin
- Temperature_Kelvin_Standard_Deviation


My analysis showed that there were little correlation between these factors and Percent_Bleaching. However,
I hope others can use my code as guideline and share their results.
